I am a guy that kinda likes git and vim. And yes, I'm one of these guys who use StackOverflow. (bruh)

Welcome to my profile, on what I added on random bullshit just for an unfunny attempt on humor.

## Kinda proud at:
- Having a sus profile picture (you can't unsee it now)
- Unfunny commit messages
- idk i'm out of possessions that i can think of

## Ey, what projects do you make:
- Curses Interactables and Games
- LOVE2D Games
- Sometimes, Javascript Games
- Maybe soon, Roblox Plugins and Modules
- SFML and C++ random stuff

## Are you cool?
yes

## Why?

## Do you code in one of the members of the C family?
~~i only touched the syntax :pensive:~~
~~never made a project, i wished i did :sob:~~
~~NVM I HAVE ONE, JUST STARTED DOING C++ AGAIN~~

## Do you wanna make malware relating to the Ukraine crisis shoved into one of your popular projects... And then getting up in jail?
~~yes~~ **no**

#### Whether you use Vim, Visual Studio, or an IDE, just get that shit done.
